    "# Using position exits in the trading strategy\n",
    "The trading strategy below explains how to incorporate exit algorithms. You will find an overview of the strategy and step-by-step instructions to integrate take profit, stop loss and day counter effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy function uses several technical indicators to generate long and short signals. Here's a brief overview of the key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategy Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "- long_signal: Generated when the 40-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- long_signal_2: Generated when a green candlestick is 4.5 times bigger than the average candlestick in the last 100 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "- short_signal: Generated when 120-day RSI is above 65 (indicating a long time of overperformance and a likely retracement).\n",
    "\n",
    "- exit1: Closes the position when the last close is under the 70-day SMA\n",
    "\n",
    "- exit2: Closes the position after the price drops over 5% in 1 day\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach we will add all the signals up. This way, multiple long or short signals appearing on the same day can amplify or cancel each other out. In this case the exits are made to exit long positions, so we will multiply them with long signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Position Sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "Positions are sized based on the ATR percentage ```weights = (entry/atr_perc)``` in the code. This is a risk management method that invests more in stable periods of low volatility and less in high volatility periods instead of dividing the weights evenly across assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding Exit Signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **take_profit** function determines whether positions should be exited based on the take profit criteria. The threshold parameter determines how many ATRs the price needs to move upwards (long) or downwards (short) from the opening price in order for the position to be closed. Use long = True (default) to apply it to long positions or long = False for short positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **stop_loss** function determines whether positions should be exited based on the stop loss criteria. The threshold parameter determines how many ATRs the price needs to move downwards (long) or upwards (short) from the opening price in order for the position to be closed. Use long = True (default) to apply it to long positions or long = False for short positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **day_counter** function determines whether positions should be exited based on the number of days in position. The threshold parameter determines how many days since entry need to pass to exit the position. Use long = True (default) to apply it to long positions or long = False for short positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights are updated by multiplying them with all the exit signals (tp, sl, dc). This effectively exits positions if **any** of the exit conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State Management\n",
    "The state is updated with the new weights and written back to ensure persistence across function calls. In this implementation, positions are forwarded every day until an exit is hit. For example - if you want to enter a position after a big green bar happens, it doesn't need to happen again the next day. The system will stay in position until an exit happens, after which it looks for an entry signal again.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Exit functions only work properly with the multi-pass backtester due to requiring previous state information.**"
